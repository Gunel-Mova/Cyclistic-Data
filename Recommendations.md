# Phase 6: ACT
## Recommendations

1. Marketing team should focus on to give brief information to casual riders how they can save money by paying in advance for annual membership and how they will get more unlimited trips everyday. They can send leaflets to casuals via emails to explain the bike products and services clearly and concisely.

2. Marketing campaigns targeting casuals can be executed for weekends and summer season. For that purpose, introducing special discounts to new members right before summer season or weekends can convert casuals into annual members.

3. Marketing campaigns targeting casuals can be executed for popular routes considering they love riding for leisure. Cheaper membership for new members in specific routes can call casuals’ attention. In addition, the duration of unlimited rides can be increased as casual riders like longer trips and perhaps, they wouldn’t want to dock bike after a short time and start again.
